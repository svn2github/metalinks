How to build Metalink Editor

You will need the following:

Python 2.6.x (2.5.x may still work, but it is no longer supported) - http://www.python.org
Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) - http://nsis.sourceforge.net
py2exe 0.6.6 - http://www.py2exe.org
wxPython 2.8 - http://www.wxpython.org

The program can be run as a normal Python script if Python is present.  NSIS 
and py2exe are not required, these are included only for supporting 
distribution to the masses without Python.


Building on Windows
-------------------
sample_setenv.bat - edit this file as appropriate for your system and rename to setenv.bat
py2exe.bat - calls py2exe to make executable files for windows and .zip package
pyinstexe.bat - calls pyinstaller to make executable files for windows and .zip package
make_installer.bat - calls py2exe.bat and makes the NSIS Windows installer
sdist.bat - creates a .zip file with the source code
nightly.bat - makes a datestamped build for all build types, calls make_installer.bat, sdist.bat

Building on UNIX/Linux
----------------------
sdist.sh - creates a .tar.gz file with the source code

Advanced Build Options
----------------------
setup.py sdist - creates an archive with the source code for distribution
setup.py clean - removes all unneeded files created during the build process
setup.py py2exe - generates binary (.exe) files that can be run on Windows (Windows Only)
setup.py install - install as a Python library on the current system
setup.py zip - packages up whatever is in the dist/ directory into a .zip file (usually run after py2exe option)
