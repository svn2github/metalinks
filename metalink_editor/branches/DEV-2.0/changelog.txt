Metalink Editor Changelog
by Hampus Wessman

Version 1.1.1
* Updated readme.txt.
* Added a todo.txt file.

Version 1.1.0 (2007-07-29)
* Fixed typo ("configuarion" => "configuration").
* Fixed an issue with encodings.
* Added support for SHA-256. Only available with Python 2.5.
* Made all text controls selectable, so that you can copy their contents.
* Fixed a bug with the license combo box.

Version 1.0.0 (2007-05-18)
* Fixed a status bar message.
* The editor seems to work fine, so it's time for the 1.0 release!

Version 0.4.1 (2007-03-19)
* Changed the UI so that the editor tells the user how many chunk checksums there are (in the status bar).
* Changed the scanning code slightly. Now it always uses a chunk length that is a power of 2 (and larger than or equal to the minimum).
* Fixed the metalink loading, so that it discards any whitespace in the beginning and the end of read data.

Version 0.4.0 (2007-03-09)
* The editor has been tested in Debian Sid and some issues have been fixed.
* Now my build script generates a tar.gz and a tar.bz2 archive too! Better than zip (can set file permission).

Version 0.3.5 (2007-03-09)
* Added a settings dialog. The settings are saved in an ini-file (wxPython puts it in some standard place).
* Added a progress dialog, when scanning a file.
* Fixed the mirror updating feature. Now it doesn't ask if the new and old filename is the same (not likely, but anyway).
* Added validation of license url.

Version 0.3.4 (2007-03-09)
* Added license fields to the editor. You can choose license from a combo box (or enter your own).

Version 0.3.3 (2007-03-08)
* Added the possibility to replace the old filename with the new in all mirrors, after scanning a file.

Version 0.3.2 (2007-03-06)
* Fixed a bug when creating a new metalink. The platform combo box lost all default choices before.

Version 0.3.1 (2007-03-06)
* Fixed saving of chunk checksums. Now it doesn't save the chunk checksums if there are only one of them! Was already fixed in the source distro...

Version 0.3.0 (2007-03-05)
* Changed the GUI, so that it works in a more standard way. Added some menus and a status bar.
* Added support for chunk checksums. They are generated automatically when scanning a file! This is one of the coolest features so far...
* Added a message in the status bar telling whether chunk checksums are present.
* Added an "about dialog" and some other minor details...

Version 0.2.7 (2007-03-04)
* Fixed a fatal bug in the win32 version. Now it works fine again!

Version 0.2.6 (2007-03-04)
* Tested the application on Debian Unstable. Fixed some issues, so now it works! Seems to need wxPython 2.6 (doesn't work with 2.4; haven' tested 2.5).

Version 0.2.5 (2007-03-2)
* Changed the user interface in a few ways. Added some new fields.
* Added validation for max total connections.
* Changed to *.metalink in browser dialogs.

Version 0.2.4 (2007-03-02)
* Fixed a bug in the error handling code.
* Added support for multiple error messages after each other and gave the user the ability to continue anyway (if possible).
* Added more data checking (max connections, publisher url and file size).
* Checks hashes more thouroughly (checks them for validity and makes them lower case).

Version 0.2.3 (2007-03-02)
* Added UK as a valid country code.
* Added validation of preference values.
* Added some new error messages and changed the way errors are handled when loading metalinks.
* Fixed maxconnections. Now it defaults to "-" (unlimited), as it was meant to be.

Version 0.2.2 (2007-03-01)
* Changed the platform field to a combo box with all the os identifiers from the Metalink 3.0 Specification.
* Added "maxconnections" from the metalink standard, for each mirror separately.

* Added better error handling.
* Added better URL checking, when saving metalinks.

Version 0.2.0 (2007-03-01)
* Added a script that automatically builds my app (installer, zip file and metalinks).
* Fixed a minor detail in setup.py. No warnings anymore!
* Fixed the file scanning feature. Can handle large files now.
* Added the possibility to select and remove multiple URLs at once.
* Added a clear button. It asks the user and then clears everything.
* Added some text to the readme (was quite empty until now).

* Fixed version texts so that they look nice in the GUI title and the generated files.
