<h1>aria2fe</h1>
<p>aria2fe by Mike Wells is a GUI front end (QT) for aria2. <a href="http://www.aria2fe.com/">http://www.aria2fe.com/</a><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p><b>"aria2fe"</b> (the "fe" stands for "front end") is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the command line (CLI) based program
				 aria2. aria2fe was designed and constructed using C++/Qt for the GNU Unix/Posix/Linux platform.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, the purpose of aria2fe is to construct the aria2 command line syntax and arguments from a point and click
				 environment and to launch aria2 via xterm. Download progress monitoring is done through xterm acting as a console
				 for aria2fe. In fact, once aria2 has been started, aria2fe can be closed which will free up the system resources
				 (physical memory) allocated to it. xterm will continue its role as console until the download is complete.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Depending
upon the type of download being done the command line for aria2 can
become quite long and complex. Given that, the chance for errors (typos
and incorrect arguments) increases dramatically. aria2fe diminishes the
chance for errors by delivering a syntactically correct command line
each and every time. Furthermore, the ability to "visualize" the
command line being constructed aids the user in argument selection.
Additionally, command line configurations can be saved to a "conf" file
and reloaded for future use. There is no limit to the number of conf
files a user may have at any one given time and a browse dialog
expedites the finding and loading process for saved configurations.</p>

is a high-speed download utility with resuming and segmented
downloading. Supported protocols are HTTP/HTTPS/FTP and BitTorrent. It
also supports Metalink version 3.0. As of 0.10.0 aria2 supports chunk
checksums in Metalink. It validates chunk checksums while downloading
files like BitTorrents. This provides a safer and more reliable
download experience. It is being actively developed by Tatsuhiro
Tsujikawa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 id="features">Features</h1>
