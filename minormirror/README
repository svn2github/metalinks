Minormirror is meant to be a Metalink generating, online mirror administration system for small-project mirroring.

The project administrator uploads files. The files are automatically hashed and when links to the files are added, the files will automatically become available for the public.
Mirrors can be full mirrors (directory based) or file mirrors (single file), and everything is kept in a single, flat-file database.

This project idea started as phpmetalink and has since been renamed.
