Currently the following is going to happen:

Import Jinja2 as a template engine (but take a look at the google docs first to see if they already included some default template engine.. you never know)
Move index.html to a template, create template directory, make "/" dynamic
Create an url parsing and validating service.. for there on it should be hacking the validation function.
License headers (GPLv3) on all code


Future plans (after the above, more question marks means less likely to happen soon):
  Create nice images/banners etc which say "our metalinks are valid"
  Create a crawler (one link deep check on all metalinks linked from a given page)
  Add a database component to cache validation results???
  Add accounts so people can be allerted if their metalinks fail validation??????


Development
===========
Start the development server above this directory using:
 dev_appserver.py metalinkvalidator

(I extracted the zip in google_appengine, so I use google_appengine/dev_appserver.py metalinkvalidator)

Update the site using
  appcfg.py update metalinkvalidator
