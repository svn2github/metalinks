Currently the following is going to (will have to) happen:

  Extend templates on a common base using extend
  Change CSS to something more beautifull
[Bram] Fetch data and handle all error messages related to that
  Create an url parsing and validating service.. for there on it should be hacking the validation function.
   - Load XML and parse it using XML
   - Detect version of the metalink?
   - Create a set of required elements (possibly use XPath to do this)
   - Create a set of common problems and ugly things (like ending with multiple whitespaces, or whitespaces at the end of a line?)
   - Check white space usage according to spec
  Create links to specs and documentation
  Write help texts and fill in the blanks on the homepage (put more text on the landing page)
  
[Bram]  License headers (GPLv3) on all code


Future plans (after the above, more question marks means less likely to happen soon):
  Create nice images/banners etc which say "our metalinks are valid"
  Create a crawler (one link deep check on all metalinks linked from a given page)
  Add a database component to cache validation results???
  Add accounts so people can be allerted if their metalinks fail validation??????


Development
===========
Start the development server above this directory using:
 dev_appserver.py metalinkvalidator

(I extracted the zip in google_appengine, so I use google_appengine/dev_appserver.py metalinkvalidator)

Update the site using
  appcfg.py update metalinkvalidator
