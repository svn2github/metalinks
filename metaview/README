This is my first ever Ruby program, so expect the worst!

INSTALLATION
  Make sure you have Ruby-GNOME, and Ruby, then you should be ok.
 It uses:
   REXML (Ruby XML, should be standard)
   Ruby (duh...)
   Ruby-GNOME2

Copy the src/metalinks-view.rb anywhere

USAGE
  The usage should be simple. A metalinks record should be given as the
first argument. Any other arguments are totally ignored and any
error is fatal for the process.

Any help is welcome, just contact me: bneijt at gmail.com
