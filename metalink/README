Read INSTALL for installation instructions.

metalink is a small program based on libgcrypt and some boost libraries.
It generates a .metalink.xml file for every file given on the commandline.

These files can be used in combination with an XSLT stylesheet to generate 
a multitude of P2P links or MD5 sum checksum files. A defauld XSL can be
generated using --genxsl. Put the XSLT in a subdirectory, like --genxsl does,
to make sure you can still hash all files without creating an metalinks record
for the XSLT file.

Be patient: the implementation isn't yet optimized and calculating 
 the hashes for 600MB can take up to two minutes on a 1 GHz machine.
 Also note that it is creating a number of hashes and for GNUnet
 links it's even symmetrically encrypting blocks of data, all this
 takes time.


	-= Caveats =-
ED2K links don't support files larger then 4GB (4294967295),
however metalink only supports ED2K links of no more then 4290048000 bytes
 (which is a nice whole number of blocks).
 
Files with a ".metalink.xml" extension will never be hashed.


	-= Examples =-
Create .metalink.xml files for all local iso files and generate the default XSL
	metalink --genxsl *.iso
	
Create one index with all files you want
	metalink -c *.iso > index.metalink.xml
