Read INSTALL for installation instructions.

metalink is a small program based on libgcrypt and some boost libraries.
It generates a metalink record on the stdout for every file given on the commandline and using the mirror list from the stdin. It is also able to
create a hash list (see the --hashlist option).

Be patient: the implementation isn't yet optimized and calculating 
 the hashes for 600MB can take up to two minutes on a 1 GHz machine.
 Also note that it is creating a number of hashes and for GNUnet
 links it's even symmetrically encrypting blocks of data, all this
 takes time.


	-= Caveats =-
ED2K links don't support files larger then 4GB (4294967295),
however metalink only supports ED2K links of no more then 4290048000 bytes
 (which is a nice whole number of blocks).
 
Files with a ".metalink" extension will never be hashed.

For and example of use:
	cd example
	./gen.sh
This will, if all goes well, generate a valid itworked.metalink file.
Use metalink --help for more information.
