First install the dependencies:
	libgcrypt
	BOOST program_options
	BOOST filesystem
	BOOST regex (as of 0.3.1)

Then, if you have A-A-P installed (aap --version) do:
	aap install

You can cleanup afterwards with: aap cleanALL

Otherwise use make:
	make
	make install (With the right rights)

All SVN development is done with ccbuild, so entering the source directory and executing ccbuild, should produce a valid binary. (http://ccbuild.sf.net/)

Some code documentation can be generated using doxygen.

More information an newer versions can be found at http://metalinks.sourceforge.net
