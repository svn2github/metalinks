First install the dependencies:
	libgcrypt
	BOOST program_options
	BOOST filesystem
	BOOST regex (as of 0.3.1)


Then, if you have A-A-P installed (aap --version) do:
	aap install

You can cleanup afterwards with: aap cleanALL

Otherwise use the autotools:
	./configure
	make
	make install (With the right rights)

with extra options for MingW:
	./configure --with-boost-program-options=mgw --with-boost-regex=mgw --with-boost-filesystem=mgw

If that fails, try the old way:
	make -f Makefile.ccbuild
	make -f Makefile.ccbuild install (With the right rights)
	

All SVN development is done with ccbuild, so entering the source directory and executing ccbuild, should produce a valid binary. (http://ccbuild.sf.net/)
If you have the autotools archive and all the GNU autotools and ccbuild, you can also run "sh bootstrap". Don't if you havn't.

Some code documentation can be generated using doxygen.


For Ubuntu users, this might work:

sudo apt-get install g++ libgcrypt-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-dev aap
sudo aap install
sudo aap cleanALL

(if not mail, please consider posting a bug on the sourceforge page)
