First install the dependencies:
	libgcrypt
	BOOST program_options
	BOOST filesystem
	BOOST regex (as of 0.3.1)


Then, if you have A-A-P installed (aap --version) do:
	aap install

You can cleanup afterwards with: aap cleanALL

Otherwise use make:
	make
	make install (With the right rights)

All SVN development is done with ccbuild, so entering the source directory and executing ccbuild, should produce a valid binary. (http://ccbuild.sf.net/)

Some code documentation can be generated using doxygen.


For Ubuntu users, this might work:

sudo apt-get install g++ libgcrypt-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-dev aap
sudo aap install
sudo aap cleanALL

(if not mail, please consider posting a bug on the sourceforge page)
