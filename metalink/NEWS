Release 0.1.0, because it's nice it needed a good high version number ;-)

 4 Sept 2005
Release of 0.0.4. Soon a stable DTD will be realized. Then the only thing for
metalink to be done is drop the libcrypto++ library in favour of libgcrypt.
This because we need libgcrypt for the symmetric cyphers (used in GNUnet).
