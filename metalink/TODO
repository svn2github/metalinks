- More documentation
- Add --version option
- Better "unknown commandline option" handling (nicer looking)
- for the mirror file: use the file as "base" urls, and be able to specify "relative" urls as
	options if needed - like say the base url listed in the file is
	"http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/centos.org/" and the relative url
	is "/4.4/isos/i386/" - patch these together to get
	"http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/centos.org/4.4/isos/i386/" but make
	sure to strip out //
- when using a md5sum file: option for whether to list all the files in one metalink, or make
	separate metalinks for each line. (Currently an ugly seperate script, see example/seperatemd5.sh)
