PHPMetalink is a serverside hashing and metalink generating collection of scripts.
The idea is to allow small projects to create mirroring systems with metalinks easily with minimal installation.

TODO
- Rename the project?
- Include the metalink-library PHP code
- Finish up the initial system
- Run an online test-case
