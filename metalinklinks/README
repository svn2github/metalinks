Metalinklinks

Metalinklinks is a small, pure C++ program what will extract the links from a metalink file. It is ment to be used to create link lists for other applications which don't support metalinks yet.

For example, using amule-tools to download all the ed2k links from a metalink file:
  metalinklinks ed2k metalinks.metalink |xargs -n1 ed2k

It is meant to be pure C++ and portable, without relying on any library. This means it simply scans the XML, so don't expect anything fancy.
